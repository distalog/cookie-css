# cookie-css

[hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) handler to allow injecting CSS from cookies.

Use it to create an endpoint that will serve CSS generated by the cookies it receive.

Combined with
[cookie-param-handler](https://github.com/distalog/cookie-param-handler)
it allows for instance to easily display dismissable consent forms on
top of existing static contents with minimum efforts.

It is specially useful to create consent screens that have to work
whether or not Jaascript is available and enabled on the client.

See code in the [example](example) directory for usage.
